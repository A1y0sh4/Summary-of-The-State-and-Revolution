# Summary of The State and Revolution
As long as the great revolutionaries are alive, the ruling classes always reward them with incessant persecutions. As soon as they die, attempts are made to transform them into harmless icons to console and mystify the oppressed classes while emptying their doctrine of its revolutionary content. The bourgeoisie and the opportunists within the working-class movement are now plotting to subject Marxism to such treatment, distorting its revolutionary soul and exalting what seems acceptable to the bourgeoisie.

Since the distortions of Marxism have spread unprecedentedly, it is our task to re-establish Marx's true doctrine of the state.

The discovery of agriculture and the urban revolution made possible the stable production of an economic surplus. Once this certain stage of development has been reached, society is divided into classes with irreconcilable economic interests; a class society is formed in which a small class of exploiters can systematically appropriate the labour-power of a large class of exploited. In order that the antagonistic classes may not destroy themselves and society in a sterile struggle, arises the necessity of a power which is, apparently, above society and which can therefore mitigate the conflict between the classes. This power is the state.

The state is the product and manifestation of irreconcilable antagonisms between classes, and its presence is necessary to the extent that class antagonisms cannot be reconciled. If the reconciliation of classes were possible, the state could neither arise nor continue to exist.
##
A state, whatever it is, is not free and is not popular.

A state is a particular organization of force intended to suppress a certain class. The exploiting classes need political domination for the maintenance of exploitation. The oppressed need it only to end exploitation and to repress the exploiters.

The overthrow of the bourgeoisie is only possible through the transformation of the proletariat into the ruling class. For this to happen, the proletariat must first become politically conscious and then capable of organizing all the working and exploited masses into a socialist economic regime.
##
The state is the means by which the ruling class of a society exercises its dictatorship over it. The bourgeois states are a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The transition from capitalism to communism will inevitably be the dictatorship of the proletariat. The ruling class of society will no longer be the exploiting bourgeois minority, but the exploited proletarian majority; it will no longer be the oppressed, but the oppressors, who will be excluded from politics.

Only those who recognize both the existence of the class struggle and the necessity of putting an end to class oppression by means of the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat, are Marxists.

Today's rampant opportunism glosses over the question of class dictatorship and educates socialists in such a way as to make them only the representatives of the best-paid workers; in this way it deprives them of the theoretical foundations necessary to achieve the radical suppression of all exploitation.
##
Any state, in order to maintain itself, needs special detachments of armed men who, by profession, protect the interests of the ruling class and maintain firm its power. The task of these armed detachments is to supervise, repress and imprison those who rebel against their oppression and those among the individual members of the ruling class who are willing to help them.

Modern centralized state power appeared in the period of the bourgeois revolution in France. The most characteristic institutions of this state machine are: the bureaucracy, the standing army and the police. The working class learns to know them the hard way.

The Commune made the bourgeois advertising phrase of "cheap government" a reality by destroying these institutions, which in fact constitute the major sources of expenditure.
##
The experience of the Paris Commune of 1871 has taught us that it is impossible to liberate the oppressed class without a violent revolution that destroys the apparatus of state power that serves the ruling class to keep it subjugated. A revolution is not a simple change of government: the subjugated class must overthrow the government with which the small class of oppressors satisfied its political needs to create one that instead fulfils those of the large oppressed class.

The first decree of the Commune was the abolition of the standing army and its replacement by the entire revolutionary people in arms. The police, as well as any other branch of the administration, were immediately stripped of their political powers and were turned into an instrument revocable at any time. Public service had to be performed for the average wage of a good worker. The magistrates were stripped of their sham independence and were made elected by universal suffrage, accountable to the people and immediately recallable.

To abolish bureaucracy it is necessary to abolish careerism, so it was prevented from achieving very lucrative jobs in banks and in joint stock companies through state employment.
##
When the bourgeois states will be suppressed by socialist revolutions and there will be no longer any social classes to maintain in oppression, there will be no need for any state. At this stage, instead of the more or less repressive government over people, the simple administration of the production processes will appear.

Repression is still necessary even after the socialist revolution, but, instead of the special institutions of a privileged minority, it will be the people themselves who will take on the tasks of state power; and, the more people actively participate in the management of the state, the less the need for this repressive power will be felt. The main cause of violations of the rules of social coexistence is the exploitation of the masses. Once this is suppressed, individual excesses will infallibly begin to die out; and with them also the socialist state.
##
The state will cease to exist when there is no longer any distinction between the members of society according to their relations to the means of production. Only then, will people gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of civil coexistence without violence, without the need for a state.

The state will become extinct when we have such a high degree of development that there will be no longer either the division of labour or the contrast between intellectual and physical labour, and labour will no longer be merely a necessary means of continuing to live, but will become the first necessity for the realization of everyone's own life.
##
With regard to the anarchists, we recognize that the abolition of the state is impossible until after the suppression of classes. For this to happen, the dictatorship of the oppressive class must be overthrown and the temporary dictatorship of the oppressed class must be established.

The anarchists want the state to be abolished even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. Either the anarchists do not understand what they are saying, or they understand it and are deliberately betraying the revolutionary movement of the proletariat.

It is impossible to abolish the principle of authority before the extinction of the state. To want to abolish all hierarchies before imperialism is defeated, is to want to abolish modern industry; it means not being able to fight imperialism with the appropriate tools and therefore surrender to it right away.
##
The bourgeois democratic republic is the best form of government for capitalism because, under it, capital bases its power so firmly that no change of persons, institutions, or parties, can shake it.

We are in favour of the democratic republic insofar as it is, under capitalism, the form of government where the exploitation of the proletariat is least bloody. But the fate reserved for the people, even in the most democratic of bourgeois republics, is still wage slavery.

Freedom, in capitalist society, always resembles what it was in the republics of ancient Greece: freedom for slave owners. Today's wage slaves, because of capitalist exploitation, are so suffocated by want and misery that the majority of the population finds itself cut off from political and social life.
##
We cannot conceive of a proletarian democracy without representative institutions and the principle of eligibility, but we can and must conceive of it without parliamentarism.

The way out of parliamentarism lies in transforming representative institutions from puppet theaters into bodies that actually work. In capitalist countries the real work of the state is carried out behind the scenes; and it is the ministries, the chancelleries, the general staffs that carry it out. In bourgeois parliaments there is nothing but gossip with the definite aim of deceiving ordinary people. Important decisions are made by the stock exchange and the banks.

The Commune was not a parliamentary body, but an executive and legislative working body at the same time. Instead of deciding once every three or six years which member of the ruling class would oppress and misrepresent the people in parliament, universal suffrage was for the active benefit of the people constituted in communes. There was a transition from the indirect democracy of parliament to the direct democracy of the Commune.
##
The transitional phase between capitalist society and communist society is socialism. In socialism, the means of production are no longer the private property of a few individuals, but instead belong to the whole society. After deducting the amount of work paid into social funds, each worker receives from society as much as he has given it.

In socialism there will still be injustices and differences of wealth, but the exploitation of man by man will no longer be possible. In socialism can be destroy the injustice constituted by the hoarding of the means of production by individuals, but not yet the injustice based on the distribution of consumer goods according to labour (and not according to needs).

"He who does not work shall not eat" and "At equal quantity of work, equal quantity of products" are the two principles that can be realized in socialism. But this is not yet communism: there is still bourgeois law which attributes to unequal people, and for a very unequal quantity of labour, an equal quantity of products.
##
A partial permanence of bourgeois law in a state in which the bourgeoisie is no longer in power is an inevitable drawback in socialism since it cannot be thought that men will learn, overnight, to work for society without any legal norms.

Bourgeois law, like all law, presupposes inequality. In fact, every law consists in the application of a single rule to different people, who are neither identical nor equal.

The law, instead of being equal, should in fact be unequal.

As long as bourgeois law is to be applied, a certain bureaucratization of the functionaries of the revolutionary proletariat itself is inevitable. But it will not be as ubiquitous as it is in the bourgeois states.
##
After overthrowing the capitalists and bureaucrats, all citizens will become the workers of the socialist state: in turn everyone will govern it and then everyone will get used to making sure that no one governs; moreover, there will no longer be unemployment and consequently working hours will be reduced. The whole society will become a great office and a great factory with equality of work and wages. But this discipline is by no means our ideal or our final goal: it is only a necessary stage to facilitate the overthrow of the bourgeois states and to bring us closer to the withering away of the socialist states.

The state will be able to become completely extinct when society has realized the principle "Everyone gives according to his ability; each one receives according to his needs", that is, when men will have become so accustomed to observing the fundamental rules of social coexistence, and work will have become so productive that they will work voluntarily according to their abilities. From the bourgeois point of view it is easy to declare that such a social system is "pure utopia".

In fact, it has never occurred to any communist to promise the immediate advent of communism without first going through socialism, since communism presupposes an incredibly higher productivity of labour than it does today.
